# 3DS.py

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vbe0201/3DS.py.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vbe0201/3DS.py)

3DS.py is a WIP port of the [Python 3.6.9 interpreter][cpython] to the Nintendo 3DS.
It allows you to run your Python scripts directly on the 3DS by having the interpreter
embedded into a homebrew application that launches a `main.py` script from the same
directory.

_Place a cool picture here later._

## Installation & Usage

_Coming soon._

## Compiling

If you want to compile from source, it is required to set up a
[devkitARM development environment][devkitarm] first. Next, you need to
install the zlib portlib by running `(dkp-)pacman -S 3ds-zlib`. Otherwise
you will get linker errors for the zlib module. Then `cd` into the 3DS.py
directory and run `make` to build the binaries and a statically linked Python
library with the corresponding header files for building Python C modules.

If you're on macOS, make sure to have gnu-sed installed. `brew install gnu-sed`
